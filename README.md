# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Myles Dunlap, Ph.D.

**Lead Data Scientist | Kaggle Competitions Master**

With over a decade of experience in data science and AI, I specialize in machine learning, NLP, computer vision, and advanced signal processing. Iâ€™ve led projects and teams, collaborating with national laboratories and cross-functional groups to solve complex challenges across various industries. While Iâ€™m passionate about staying at the forefront of AI through **Kaggle Competitions**, where Iâ€™m ranked in the top 1% of ~173,000 competitors, I also believe in keeping solutions practical and straightforward. I follow the "Keep It Simple" philosophy, focusing on delivering reliable, scalable results with a pragmatic approach. I'm dedicated to solving real-world problems, driving business impact through actionable insights, and sharing knowledge with the community.
